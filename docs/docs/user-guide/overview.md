## Key Concepts

### Projects and Tasks
Projects are the main organizational unit in the system. Each project can contain multiple tasks, and tasks can have time entries, files, and comments associated with them.

    A[Project] --> B[Task 1]
    A --> C[Task 2]
    A --> D[Task 3]
    B --> E[Time Entry]
    B --> F[Files]
    B --> G[Comments]
    C --> H[Time Entry]
    D --> I[Time Entry]
```

### Invoice Workflow
The invoice workflow follows a structured process from creation to payment:

```mermaid

    A[Create Invoice] --> B[Review & Edit]
    B --> C[Send to Client]
    C --> D[Payment Processing]
    D --> E[Mark as Paid]
    E --> F[Archive]
```

### Client Relationship Management
Clients are central to the system, with relationships to projects, invoices, and communications:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] --> B[Projects]
    A --> C[Invoices]
    A --> D[Communications]
    A --> E[Portal Access]
    B --> F[Tasks & Time]
    C --> G[Payments]
```
