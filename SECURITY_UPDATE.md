# Security Middleware Update

## Overview
This document summarizes the recent security enhancements and TypeScript improvements made to the Project Invoice Management System backend.

## Changes Made

### TypeScript Type Safety Fix
- **File**: `backend/src/middleware/security.ts`
- **Change**: Fixed type assertion for session-based CSRF token validation
- **Details**: Changed `req.session?.csrfToken` to `(req as any).session?.csrfToken` to properly handle session type assertions in TypeScript

### Comprehensive Security Middleware Implementation

#### Multi-Tier Rate Limiting
- **General API**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Authentication**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **Password Reset**: 3 attempts per hour per IP
- **File Upload**: 10 uploads per minute per IP

#### Request Security
- **Sanitization**: Recursive XSS and injection attack prevention
- **NoSQL Injection Prevention**: MongoDB injection protection with monitoring
- **Size Limits**: Configurable payload size limits (default: 10MB)

#### Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- XSS Protection
- Frame Options (DENY)
- Content Type Options (nosniff)
- Referrer Policy
- Permissions Policy

#### CSRF Protection
- Cross-Site Request Forgery protection with token validation
- Skips GET requests and authentication endpoints
- Requires `x-csrf-token` header for non-GET requests

#### Security Monitoring
- Suspicious request pattern detection
- Comprehensive logging with IP tracking
- Request duration monitoring
- Security event logging

#### Additional Features
- **IP Whitelisting**: Optional IP-based access control
- **API Key Validation**: External integration security
- **Security Logger**: Request monitoring and suspicious activity detection

## Documentation Updates

### Updated Files
1. **README.md**: Updated main project documentation with comprehensive security features
