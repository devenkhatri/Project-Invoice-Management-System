- âœ… **PUT /api/tasks/:id** - Update task status, priority, etc.
  - Status change handling
  - Automatic project progress recalculation
  - Admin-only access control

- âœ… **DELETE /api/tasks/:id** - Remove task
  - Prevents deletion of tasks with billed time entries

  - Admin-only access control

### 3. Time Tracking Endpoints
- âœ… **POST /api/time-entries** - Log work hours with task/project
  - Task and project validation
  - Time range validation
  - Automatic task status updates
  - Project cost recalculation

- âœ… **GET /api/time-entries** - Get entries with filtering
  - Filtering by project, task, date range, billable status
  - Client access control (only their projects)
  - Enhanced with task and project information
  - Summary calculations

- âœ… **PUT /api/time-entries/:id** - Update time entry
  - Prevents updates to billed entries
  - Task hours recalculation
  - Project cost updates

- âœ… **DELETE /api/time-entries/:id** - Remove time entry

### 4. Project Status Updates and Progress Calculation
- âœ… **Automatic Progress Calculation**
  - Based on completed vs total tasks
  - Real-time updates when tasks change
  - Progress percentage tracking

- âœ… **Status Management**
  - Automatic task completion when project marked complete
  - Status validation and business logic
  - Timeline and deadline tracking

### 5. Project Analytics Endpoints
- âœ… **GET /api/analytics/projects/:id** - Project analytics
  - Task completion analytics
  - Time tracking analytics
  - Budget utilization
  - Profitability analysis
  - Timeline progress
  - Expense analytics

- âœ… **GET /api/analytics/dashboard** - Dashboard analytics
  - Overall project statistics
  - Task summaries
  - Time tracking summaries
  - Financial analytics
  - Client-specific filtering

- âœ… **GET /api/analytics/time** - Time tracking analytics
  - Grouping by date or project
  - Summary calculations
  - Client access control

### 6. Error Handling and Validation
- âœ… **Comprehensive Validation**
  - Joi schema validation for all inputs
  - Business logic validation
  - Data integrity checks

- âœ… **Error Handling**
  - Consistent error response format
  - Proper HTTP status codes
  - Detailed error messages
  - Security considerations

### 7. Authentication and Authorization
- âœ… **JWT Authentication**
  - Token-based authentication
  - User verification
  - Session management

- âœ… **Role-Based Authorization**
  - Admin vs Client access control
  - Resource-specific permissions
  - Client data isolation

### 8. Integration Tests
- âœ… **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
  - Projects API tests (`src/routes/__tests__/projects.test.ts`)
  - Tasks API tests (`src/routes/__tests__/tasks.test.ts`)
  - Time Entries API tests (`src/routes/__tests__/time-entries.test.ts`)
  - Mock implementations for external dependencies
  - Authentication and authorization testing

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Express.js** REST API with TypeScript
- **Google Sheets** as backend database via SheetsService
