- `registerWebhook(url, events, secret)` - Registers webhook endpoint
- `triggerWebhook(event, data)` - Sends webhook notifications
- `validateWebhookSignature()` - Verifies webhook authenticity

### 5. Data Synchronization and Conflict Resolution
**File:** `backend/src/services/sync.service.ts`

**Features:**
- Automatic conflict detection and resolution
- Multiple resolution strategies (last-write-wins, merge, manual)
- Sync operation queuing and processing
- Audit trail for sync operations

**Key Methods:**
- `startSync()` - Initiates synchronization process
- `queueSyncOperation()` - Queues sync operation
- `resolveConflict()` - Resolves data conflicts

### 6. Comprehensive API Endpoints
**File:** `backend/src/routes/integrations.ts`

**Endpoint Categories:**
- **GST Reports:** `/api/integrations/gst/gstr1`, `/api/integrations/gst/gstr3b`
- **E-Invoice:** `/api/integrations/e-invoice/generate`, `/api/integrations/e-invoice/qr`
- **Workflows:** `/api/integrations/workflows/rules`, `/api/integrations/workflows/trigger`
- **Webhooks:** `/api/integrations/webhooks/register`, `/api/integrations/webhooks`
- **API Keys:** `/api/integrations/api-keys`
- **Third-party:** `/api/integrations/quickbooks/sync`, `/api/integrations/xero/sync`
- **Compliance:** `/api/integrations/compliance/audit-trail`

### 7. Third-party Integrations
**Supported Integrations:**
- **QuickBooks Online:** Invoice synchronization
- **Xero:** Accounting data sync
- **Stripe/PayPal/Razorpay:** Payment processing
- **External APIs:** Webhook notifications

### 8. API Documentation
**File:** `backend/src/docs/integrations-api.yaml`

**Features:**
- Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Detailed endpoint documentation
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Example requests and responses

### 9. Comprehensive Testing
**File:** `backend/src/__tests__/integrations.test.ts`

**Test Coverage:**
- GST report generation tests
- E-invoice functionality tests
- Workflow engine tests
- Webhook service tests
- API endpoint integration tests
- Error handling tests

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication for all endpoints
- API key management for third-party access
- Role-based access control
- Request rate limiting

### Data Security
- Webhook signature verification
- Encrypted data transmission
